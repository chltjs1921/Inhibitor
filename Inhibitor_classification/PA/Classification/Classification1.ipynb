Tracing is expensive and the excessive number of tracings could be due to (1) creating @tf.function repeatedly in a loop, (2) passing tensors with different shapes, (3) passing Python objects instead of tensors. For (1), please define your @tf.function outside of the loop. For (2), @tf.function has experimental_relax_shapes=True option that relaxes argument shapes that can avoid unnecessary retracing. For (3), please refer to https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/customization/performance#python_or_tensor_args and https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/function for  more details.\n","1/1 [==============================] - 0s 2ms/step - loss: 1.3493 - accuracy: 0.6000\n","\n"," Accuracy: 0.6000\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"mquYhWxamkGO"},"source":[""],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"8Gl1fI0jmkGO"},"source":[""],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
